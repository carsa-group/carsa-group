In the DARSA group, we develop and apply **remote-sensing tools** and innovative **open-source machine-learning methods** to make agroecosystems more **productive, sustainable and resilient**. We actively collaborate with other researchers in the [Center for Quantitative Genetics and Genomics](https://qgg.au.dk/en/) as well as other researchers in [Aarhus University](https://international.au.dk/), and worldwide to target both the breeding and production sides of agriculture. In the midst of severe environmental crises, we aim to lead a new, digital and sustainable, green revolution.
