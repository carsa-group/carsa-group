The DARSA group is part of the [Center for Quantitative Genetics and Genomics](https://qgg.au.dk/en/)(QGG), in
[Aarhus University](https://international.au.dk/). 
Within DARSA, we develop and apply **remote-sensing tools** and innovative **open-source machine-learning methods** to make agroecosystems more **productive, sustainable and resilient**.
We collaborate with other members of the [QGG](https://qgg.au.dk/en/) as well as with other researchers in Aarhus and worldwide to target both the breeding and production sides of agriculture. 
Amid severe environmental crises, we aim to lead a new, digital and sustainable, green transition. The DARSA group recently started, and we are actively looking for collaborators and new members, so **do not hesitate to [contact us](#contact)**.
