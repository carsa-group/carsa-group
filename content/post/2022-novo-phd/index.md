## Open PhD Position

Please also see the [official posting](TODO).

### Project Description
TODO COPY FROM PHD ADD

### Applicant's Profile and Eligibility

TODO COPY FROM PHD ADD

We believe [diversity leads to better reaseach](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1700616114), therefore, we value applicants with diverse backgrounds.

### Supervision

Our primary goal is for our students to succeed by helping them to develop and achieve their career goals. As such, we support help students take the project in their own direction, within the original scope, and encourage flexibility and new viewpoints as the project moves forward. The applicant should expect a weekly meeting with [Quentin Geissmann](auto-qgeissmann), their direct supervisor. Students are encouraged to collaborate within and outside of the group and will be given (funded) opportunities to present their research at international conferences. We also consider it the supervisor's role to ensure students feel safe and included in their work environment.



### Location and Facilities

The research takes place in the [QGG](https://qgg.au.dk/en/) in [Aarhus University (AU)](https://international.au.dk/).
AU is a world-class university (the largest in Denmark), with outstanding opportunities for collaboration on this particular project.
Aarhus itself is a vibrant city with an [active cultural life](https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/apr/05/aarhus-denmark-city-of-culture-2017), a [dynamic student community](https://www.visitaarhus.com/groups/study-aarhus) and a very high standard of living.
