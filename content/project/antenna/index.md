"ANTENNA" is a [biodiversa+](https://www.biodiversa.eu/2022/10/07/2022-2023-joint-call/) project conducted by a European consortium (with leading scientists from Germany, Netherlands (Naturalis), Spain, Denmark, Ireland and Greece). 

Our overarching goal is to develop **modern technologies, such as robotics, computer vision, and molecular methods** to complement traditional approaches, and ultimately help overcome key **pollinator monitoring gaps**. The Role of DARSA in ANTENNA is to develop open-source, and readily usable camera-based and citizen-science methods to increase taxonomic and geographic coverage, speed, accuracy, content and efficiency of identification, and temporal resolution of pollinator monitoring.
